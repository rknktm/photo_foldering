# photo_foldering
In this python work, I tried to folder the files which are on my computer according to their creation time.
First of all, I tried to folder the photos and video images according to their modified date using  os module and datetime module. 
Then I tried to get the bith time of the files by Pillow module and tried to copy these files to the appropriate directories.
And the program still needs improvement.
